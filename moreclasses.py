#Number Served: Start with your program from Exercise 9-1 (page 162). Add an attribute called number_served with a default value of 0. 
#Create an instance called restaurant from this class. 
#Print the number of customers the restaurant has served, and then change this value and print it again.

#add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the number of customers that have been served. 
#Call this method with a new number and print the value again.

#Add a method called increment_number_served() that lets you increment the number of customers whoâ€™ve been served. 
#Call this method with any number you like that could represent how many customers were served in, say, a day of business.

# reset_login_attempts() that resets the value of login_attempts to 0.

#Make an instance of the User class and call increment_login_attempts() several times. Print the value of login_attempts to make
#  sure it was incremented properly, and then call reset_login_attempts(). Print login_attempts again to make sure it was reset to 0.
