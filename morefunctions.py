#Messages: Make a list containing a series of short text messages. 
# Pass the list to a function called show_messages(), w
#which prints each text message.

#8-10. Sending Messages: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 
# 8-9. Write a function called send_messages() that prints each text message and
# moves each message to a new list called sent_messages as itâ€™s printed. 
# After calling the function, print both of your lists to make sure the messages were moved correctly.

#8-11. Archived Messages: Start with your work from Exercise 8-10. Call the function 
# send_messages() with a copy of the list of messages. After calling the function, 
# print both of your lists to show that the original list has retained its messages.
